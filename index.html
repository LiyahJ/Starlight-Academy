            <h4>About Starlight Academy</h4>
            <p>Starlight Academy was established in 1988, by our first headmistress Musa Liua. She started the school to give people a chance to train their raw talent & turn them into even
                better idols. Eventually through her hard work & determination of training those who decided to attend her start up school, the academy became the number one idol school in
                the country. The reason our academy is called  "Starlight" is because we want all of our students to shine like stars wherever they are in the world.
